    "1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "Answer :-The Boolean data type is a data type in computer programming that represents truth values. It has two possible values: true and false. In programming languages, these values are typically represented using the keywords \"true\" and \"false\" respectively. In some languages, the values can also be represented numerically as 1 for true and 0 for false. The specific syntax for representing Boolean values may vary depending on the programming language being used."

    "\n",

    "range(0, 10, 1): This is similar to the second example, but here the step value is explicitly set to 1. The start value is 0, and the stop value is 10 (exclusive).
